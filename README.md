# Shellcode (Praise the lawd)

This is just a collection of shellcode I wrote a few years ago. I don't know whether or not these work anymore since it has been a while, so if there is an error or something that seems redundant, please let me know.

### Warning
If you run this on your production machine instead of a sandbox or vm and there is memory corruption, don't blame me
